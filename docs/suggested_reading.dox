@page suggested_reading Suggested Reading

- [Type Theory and Formal Proof: An Introduction](https://amzn.eu/d/8dl6Ktx)
  this is **the most important** book.
  If you read nothing else, try at least to read the first 6 chapters of this.
- [Types and Programming Languages](https://amzn.eu/d/iBVHn9a)
  is a famous textbook in this field.
  You might come across many papers and publications that reference it.
- [Interactive Theorem Proving and Program Development: Coqâ€™Art](https://amzn.eu/d/2syZqOi)
  is a bit of a more advanced reading.
  It covers advanced topics like the Calculus of Inductive Construction,
  whilst also showing the famous theorem prover _Coq_.
  It is also referenced by many papers and publications,
  including the above 2 books.
- [I Got Plenty o' Nuttin'](https://personal.cis.strath.ac.uk/conor.mcbride/PlentyO-CR.pdf)
  is the seminal paper introducing Quantitative Type Theory.
  As usual from Conor McBride, it's written in a very peotic style,
  which makes it fun to read but you might also want to read the next one.
- [The Syntax and Semantics of Quantitative Type Theory](https://bentnib.org/quantitative-type-theory.pdf)
  this is a follow up paper on Quantitative Type Theory from Bob Atkey;
  it reads a bit easier than Conor's paper and it also fixes a couple of "bugs".
